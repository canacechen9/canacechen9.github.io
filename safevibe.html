            <p>This is a team project I made at the European Innovation Academy 2023 with Emilia Swierzb, George Seymour, Meira Harris and Lucas Piresâ€‹. We developed a safety wristband called Safe Vibe for events and festivals. In a situation where phones falter in crowded spaces, Safe Vibe offers wireless communication through colour-coded LED lights and discreet vibration. Unlike competitors tied to mobile networks or plagued by battery issues, Safe Vibe communicates through Radio Frequency, which allows users to locate missing companions without relying on the internet or any mobile devices.</p>
            <p>Our business model follows a B2B approach, wherein we produce wristbands in bulk at a cost-effective price. These wristbands are then rented out to festival organisers, who, in turn, offer them as an enticing additional service to event attendees alongside their tickets. This ensures affordability for the attendees while generating extra revenue for the events. Additionally, we explore merchandising options for the wristbands.</p>
            <p>Upon entering the event as a group, each user is assigned a specific colour for identification. When someone is missing, users can simply press a button on their wristband, selecting their missing friend through the colour-coded LED light. The LED light flashes in the chosen color and intensifies as they approach their friend, complemented by a strengthening vibration. Beyond its practical use, the wristband serves a dual purpose by transforming into a festive light, enhancing the overall atmosphere and enriching the event experience.</p>
