            <p>This project delves into the pervasive issue of gender inequality through a data visualization approach. Utilizing the comprehensive dataset of the World Data of Gender Inequality Index 2021, the project aims to shed light on various aspects of inequality between women and men across 195 countries. The dataset encompasses key indicators such as the Gender Inequality Index, maternal mortality ratio, adolescent birth rate, share of seats in parliament, population with secondary education, and Labor force participation.</p>
            <p>The visualization is implemented using p5.js and comprises five scenes, each representing one of the aforementioned indicators. The central visual element is a symbolic representation of a uterus adorned with flowers, encapsulating the essence of femininity, beauty, and vitality. The colour of the uterus dynamically changes based on the underlying data, providing a visually compelling representation of gender disparities.</p>
            <p>Analysis of the data reveals a correlation between higher levels of development and lower rates of maternal mortality and adolescent birth rates. Additionally, countries with greater development tend to exhibit a higher proportion of women occupying parliamentary seats and a more balanced gender ratio in secondary education attainment. However, a persistent global trend indicates that the percentage of women in the labour force lags behind that of men, albeit with more pronounced disparities in countries with mid-level human development.</p>
            <p>The project also acknowledges the significance of feminism as a social movement advocating for gender equality. Recognizing the diverse roles women undertake, both paid and unpaid, including caregiving and maintaining a healthy home environment, the project seeks to foster a deeper understanding of the multifaceted contributions of women in society (Lorber, 2010).</p>
            <p>Through its visual representation of gender inequality data, this project aims to raise awareness, inspire dialogue, and encourage actions towards a more equitable future for all genders.</p>
