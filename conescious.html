            <p>This project was made in collaboration with Diana Milena for the Microsoft MadeCode Game Jam 2022. You can scan the QR code to play the game.</p>
            <p>The project was made to raise awareness for colour blindness. We designed 3 small retro games based on the 3 types of colour blindness-- deuteranopia, protanopia and tritanopia. The concept is to collect the missing cone cells that cause the colour blindness. We extracted the colours from the windows 11 accessibility colour palette. Each of these palettes was made to help people with a certain type of colour blindness, so that they can experience the game like everyone else, and other people can gain a perspective from their world. </p>
