                <p>My name is Canace (Yiran, 逸然) Chen, and I'm a creative technologist, artist, interaction/UI/UX designer based in London, UK. I recently graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Creative Computing from the Creative Computing Institute, University of the Arts London. My journey has been shaped by a series of serendipitous discoveries that have steered me towards a path where art and technology converge. </p>
                <p>It all started by accident — my initial passion for art was reignited when I stumbled upon the multimedia and programming class during high school. What was meant to be an system error became a turning point, leading me to explore the endless possibilities technology offers in creative work. From that point, I delved deeper into design, coding, and game development, using tools like Adobe suites and experimenting with new forms of creative expression. As I moved into university, these experiments evolved, and I began to immerse myself in fields like VR, AR, interactive installations, machine learning, and generative AI.</p>
                <p>My university has given me the platform to explore these intersections and build on my understanding of human-computer interaction. Through my undergraduate projects, I've worked on a range of exciting technologies—whether it's game, wearable technology, or app development — all with the aim to push boundaries and challenge the norm.</p>
                <p>Working as a Creative Technologist at George P. Johnson has allowed me to apply my academic knowledge in real-world contexts, turning creative ideas into impactful, interactive experiences that engage and inspire audiences. My focus on using technology for social good, and creating experiences that grow connection, continues to fuel my passion for this field. As I look ahead, I am excited to keep experimenting, learning, and shaping the future of creative technology.</p>
