                <p>My name is Canace (Yiran, 逸然) Chen, I am an undergraduate student at the Creative Computing Institute, University of the Arts London. I made all the projects on this website, including the website itself. </p>
                <p>I discovered my passion for art by accident, and then lost it unexpectedly. When I was five, I joined my friends for a drawing class; while they all enjoyed themselves, the experience grabbed me, and from then, I was helplessly enchanted. I practiced and played and experimented, entangling myself further in my art throughout primary school. Even at that age, I was sure I had found my calling that would shape my whole life. Then I left China for Australia, where art was so unfamiliar to me, formed by and for a different culture, responding to a different world. In a time of transition that should have perhaps brought me closer to my work, I became alienated from it. Art was as strange here as my new life.</p>
                <p>In high school, I was driven towards STEM subjects. My mother taught maths; I had a natural aptitude and was pushed to pursue it. I loved science, which made it easier to conform to an academic environment that muted the arts, prizing STEM fields above all else. But again, art was thrown into my path: at fifteen, a system error enrolled me in a multimedia and programming class by mistake. Here, the hands of technology allowed me to grasp my creativity again. I learned to use the Adobe suites, to make websites, and to code games. I explored digital culture, and emerging forms of transmedia. An adolescence spent in science proved a crucial detour from my paint-splattered childhood as finally my two great loves converged. My passions fuelled each other and I found courage to experiment, to fail, to borrow from my past and get inspired from the future. The cultural fractures that once bewildered me came to sculpt my particular style and the themes and aesthetics that centre much of my work.</p>
                <p>This convergence evolved again when I participated in Queensland University of Technology’s STEM camp. Collaborating with other young scientists with other areas of expertise, I was involved in the design of an earphone clip that indicated UV index to improve sun safety. I gained experience working in a team, which emphasised to me the significance of diverse identities, perspectives and skill-sets in modern design.</p>
                <p>I found art and science by coincidence, but I had to learn resilience and adaptability to cultivate my passions. During my undergraduate study at the CCI, I am turning these pivotal accidents into my defining purpose. CCI allows me to work at the most fascinating of frontiers, the intersection of technology and art, where boundaries are challenged, and innovation is key. My next exhilarating step is to leap into the new, and establish the path myself.  </p>
