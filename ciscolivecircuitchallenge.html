            <p>The Cisco Live Circuit Challenge was designed as part of the World of Solutions room at Cisco Live 2024 Amsterdam. It is an AR game using the Nintendo Switch to spotlight the Cisco × McLaren partnership. The inspiration is the classic video game – Mario Kart. The activation elevates the traditional experience with mixed media and live action remote control. The cameras on miniature remote controlled cars give the users the viewpoint from the cars POV.</p>
            <p>On top of the real world footage, the AR technology overlays virtual elements, such as iconic Mario Kart characters and power-ups, onto the live video feed captured by the kart’s camera. This innovative integration allows users to see and interact with their favourite Mario Kart elements in real-time, creating an immersive and dynamic gameplay experience.</p>
            <p>The McLaren x Webex by Cisco partnership is built on behind the scenes technology that improves innovation, communication, teamwork & ultimately performance on the track. The challenge offers the users an exciting game experience while learning about the “the race behind the race”, shadowing all the work & innovation that goes on in the background.</p>
