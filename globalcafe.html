            <p>This activation was part of the DP World Pavilion at the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28). It is a café designed for the users to take a rest and enjoy a cup of drink while engaging with stories on the pivotal role DP World plays in shaping global trade. Through a series of captivating “farm to fork” stories, we unveil DP World’s profound impact on everyday products, from coffee and tea to oranges, illustrating their integral role in the global supply chain.</p>
            <p>As users place their drink orders, an animation sequence is triggered, unfolding across café-esque artwork and within the counter top, seamlessly weaving the stories of these products into the fabric of the experience. Whether savouring their refreshments amidst the animated narratives or eagerly sharing their newfound knowledge with others, this activation promises to be both fun and informative.</p>
