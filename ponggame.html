            <p>The aesthetic design of this Pong Game is based on the album cover Major Arcana by Speedy Ortiz. I took the elements from the album and used them in the game. For example, I cut the 2 fish and used them as the 2 bats. The coral was used as the ball. The game layout and background design were also based on the album cover. I found a similar image and used photoshop to make the colour match the original. I used the yellow "sticky note" as the pop-up window to show result. I also found similar text font on google font and used it in the game.</p>
