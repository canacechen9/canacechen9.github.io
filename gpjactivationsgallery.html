            <p>This project explores the application of advanced immersive technologies in experiential marketing, combining AR with VR to create a novel app on Apple Vision Pro that showcases a series of interactive brand activations. The app allows users to either engage with highly detailed miniature models or immerse themselves in life-size virtual space.</p>
            <p>The development process was informed by research into the effectiveness of immersive technologies in marketing and user experience design. Studies indicate that AR and VR can significantly increase user engagement, enhance recall, and create a stronger emotional connection to the brand, compared to traditional marketing mediums. This project applies these findings to deliver a dual-experience platform where users can toggle between AR and VR to gain a comprehensive understanding of marketing activations.</p>
            <p>The app leverages spatial computing capabilities to offer intuitive navigation and interaction, making complex information both accessible and engaging. This initiative not only showcases the technology but also serves as a unique platform to document the design details behind each activation.</p>
