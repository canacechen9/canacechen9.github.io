            <p>The major part of the photograph seems dark and depressing, however, the darkness in the room contrasts to the brightness outside the window. There are light tubes with very weak light messily suspended from the roof. The skeleton is standing in the dark room alone but yearning for the light outside of the window.  The buildings outside represents the life he is looking for. This photograph tells regardless of what situation we are in or what we have experienced, there is always a room in our heart that seeks and values light and hope. That is part of our nature.
