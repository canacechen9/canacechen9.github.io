            <p>The main idea for the artwork was from an essay written by a Chinese writer, Han Han. In his essay, "Seeing Ourselves in a Cup", he analysed problems in the Chinese society through a glass with a spitball dropping down in the water. I used ProCreate in this project; it is a glass with a spitball drowning in the water under a beam of light. The spitball represents an individual and the water is the society. The water is eroding the spitball little by little just like what the society does to people. At the bottom of the glass, there is a shadow of a person trying hard to survive in the surging sea. It is well explained of the old saying— “Every new adjustment is a crisis in self-esteem”.</p>
