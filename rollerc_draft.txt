<p><strong>2 Considerations</strong></p>
<p>2.1 Observations<br>1. It was observed that the height of the roller coaster has to be within [0, 90] and the horizontal distance is within [0, 250].<br> 2. It was observed that the ride is smooth and the slope is defined everywhere on its domain.<br> 3. It was observed that the angle of the steepest descent of the roller coaster does not exceed 80 degrees.<br> 4. It was observed that the ride consists of at least 3 different types of the functions from polynomial, trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic.</p>
<p>2.2 Assumptions<br> 1. Since the height of the roller coaster is within [0, 90] and the horizontal distance is within [0, 250], it is assumed that the domain of the roller coaster is [0, 230] and range is [0, 88.5]<br> 2. Base on assumption 1, it is assumed the roller coaster starts at (0,15) and ends at (230,0).<br> 3. According to basic physics principles, the first hill of the roller coaster is assumed to be the highest hill of the ride (Liddle, 2013).</p>
<p><strong>3 Mathematical concepts and procedures</strong></p>
<p>To come up with the functional model of the roller coaster, the initial method was to draw the design of the roller coaster on a sketching paper and input the coordinates of key points into Excel for the equations to be generated. However, since the major process was done manually, the design was inaccurate and did not satisfy the specifications. The new method was to calculate the derivative of the end point of the previous function first and then by solving simultaneous equations, the equation of the next function was generated. The refinement of the model was further investigated based on the smoothness, the angles of the descent and the excitement factor. By this way, the functional model has been developed to satisfy all the specifications and at the same time achieved a great value of excitement factor.</p>
<p><strong>4 Determining the solution and refinement of the model</strong></p>
<p>4.1 Generate the profile model<br> Initial method:<br> 1. The profile of the roller coaster was designed and sketched on a graphing paper.<br> 2. The key points of each function on the profile were found and input into Excel.<br> 3.	A scetter graph was generated and trend lines were used to find the equation of each function.<br> 4. The generated model was checked to meet all specifications by calculations.</p>

<p>New method:<br> 1. One point (does not coincide with the starting point) was found within the domain and range of the functional model and it was connected with the starting point by adding an exponential trend line.<br> 2. The equation of Function 1 was y=15e^0.0693x given by Excel. Function 1 was extended to when x=20, so substitutes x=20 into the equation:</p>
<p>Function 1 ends at (20,60).<br> 3. As Function 1 is an exponential function, the derivative of its end point can be found using the chain rule. If y = e^f(X), let u = f(x), then y = e^n.</p>
