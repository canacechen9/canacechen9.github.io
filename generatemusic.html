            <p>This problem-solving and modelling task is to generate a piece of melody using a suitable mathematical method. To achieve this purpose, an appropriate sample of music was used as reference data to develop the model. Both technological, for example, Excel and graphic calculator, and mathematical procedures including matrices were used to generate the melody. A trail of simulated notes was included in this report to help with the further evaluation and analysis on comparing the melody generated by mathematics procedure and the melody composed by an artist.</p>
