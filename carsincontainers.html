            <p>This project is a stand-alone digital activation / tool that showcases DP World’s cars in containers services as part of their Finished Vehicle Logistics solutions. It focuses on key USP’s from these services and is flexible enough to use at both events and as an online demo to aid in sales and commercial objectives.</p>
            <p>The home screen is a ‘screensaver’ animation attractor sequence. The user can interact with the 3D model to inspect. Then a video explains "Why cars in containers?". When the user selects Loading Options, the menu background animates down, to reveal the Sub Menu Options. They will witness three remarkable systems – the R-Rak system, EL-Rak system, and SKD-Rak system – each meticulously depicted in stunning detail. From loading to transportation, watch the seamless journey of vehicles within secure containers. ​</p>
