            <p>“Before the Sun Rises” is an AR storytelling artworks. It is comprised of photo prints, AR animation and sound. The photo combined with the virtual layer tells an imaginary story that happens before the sun rises. According to the VOA news, people worldwide have recently become more stressed because of the economy, pandemic, media and many other reasons (Mekouar, 2022). The purpose of this project is to let the viewers take a break from all the problems they are experiencing, just like sleeping at night. To inspire them by creating their understanding and connection with the stories, and to remind them that even if they are in the dark right now, the sun will rise soon.</p>
            <p>The inspiration for the artwork was Apple’s live photo. When the user presses and holds a live photo, a short animation from the time when the photo was taken will be played. The artwork uses Augmented Reality (AR) technology; when the viewer scans the photo print with the mobile app, the photo will turn into AR animation to tell the story behind it.</p>
            <p>AR empowers the connection between the human senses and technology; it blends digital information with the real world for people to have a unique perspective. This gives AR the potential to influence people emotionally and socially (Pucihar and Kljun, 2018). Choosing AR allows viewers to experience the artwork with multiple senses, which not only gives the viewers a more engaging and immersive experience but also makes the artwork inclusive for a wider range of people. </p>
            <p>The storyboards was designed using a sketchbook. The frame-by-frame drawings were made with Procreate and the Da Vinci Resolve was used for the video editing. The AR output was implemented using the mobile app Artivive. However, additional features were developed with relevant research to ensure the whole experience is smooth and intuitive.</p>
